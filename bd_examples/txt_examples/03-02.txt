A real estate agency needs a database to manage its rented properties. Within this system, it is possible to register agents, renters, properties, and property owners.

- A real estate agent can manage more than one property, just as a property owner can own multiple properties.
- A renter may have rented more than one property over time, and they can have none, or one active rental at the same time.
