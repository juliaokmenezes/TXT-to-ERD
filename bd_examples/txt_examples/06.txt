A real estate agency needs a database to manage its rented properties. Within this system, it is possible to register agents, tenants, properties, and property owners.

- A real estate agent can manage more than one property, just as a property owner can own multiple properties.
- A tenant may have rented more than one property over time, but they cannot have more than one active rental at the same time.
- Rent payments must be made monthly, including information on the payment and receiving accounts. It is also necessary to indicate the month for which the payment was made.
- A contract must include a start and end date, as well as a field for clauses. At the end of the contract, there must be an indication of whether the security deposit was refunded or not.
- If the contract value exceeds 50% of the tenantâ€™s reported salary, a guarantor must sign the contract jointly
