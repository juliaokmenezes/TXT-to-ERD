A real estate agency needs a database to manage its rented properties. Within this system, it is possible to register real estate agent, renters, properties, and property owners.

- A real estate agent can manage more than one property, from different owners.
- A property owner can own multiple properties.
- A renter may have no active rentals or just one.
- A property only has one owner, and each property can be rented by only one renter by time.
- Each property is managed by just one  real estate agent
