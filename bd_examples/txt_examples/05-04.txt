A real estate agency needs a database to manage its rented properties. Within this system, it is possible to register agents, renters, properties, and property owners.

- A real estate agent can manage more than one property, just as a property owner can own multiple properties.
- A renter may have rented more than one property over time, but they cannot have more than one active rental at the same time.
- Rent payments must be made monthly, including information on the payment and receiving accounts. It is also necessary to indicate the month for which the payment was made.
- A the rental agreement must include a start and end date, as well as a field for clauses. At the end of the contract, there must be an indication of whether the security deposit was refunded or not.
- The agreement must register the date of rent payment, and the amount of the penalty for late payment. It should have a field to fill in information about the utensils present in the property
