A real estate agency needs a database to manage its rented properties. Within this system, it is possible to register a real estate agent,  renters, properties, and property owners.


- A real estate agent can manage more than one property, from different owners.
- A property owner can own multiple properties. 
- A renter may have rented none, or, more than one property over time.
- A property only has one owner, and could only be rented by one renter at a time.
- Each property is managed by just one  real estate agent
