A real estate agency needs a database to manage its rented properties. Within this system, it is possible to register A real estate agents, renters, properties, and property owners.


- A real estate agent can manage more than one property, from different owners.
- A property owner can own multiple properties. 
- A renter can only rent one property ever.
- A property only has one owner, and each property can be rented by only one renter at a time.
- Each property is managed by just one real estate agent
